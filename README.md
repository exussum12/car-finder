# Car finder

This is a simple app that parses the AutoTrader.co.uk search results, grabs all the latest cars on the 1st page and parses each individual cars JSON document. It will continously do this and score them based on set criteria, showing me the best cars based on my rules.

It's heavily hard coded.
